This way, the content has another origin than your application... and it can't access the parent via window.parent!\r\n\r\nOne other problem is that iframes can set their width to 100% - but that doesn't work for the height. So, we use the message-transfer functions... a sender in the \"injected\" code, and a reciever on the parent page which can update the height of the iframe element.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
